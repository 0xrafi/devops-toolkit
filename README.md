# DevOps-Toolkit

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my DevOps-Toolkit, a collection of practical and effective scripts that have helped me streamline and automate things.
## Categories

- **Deployment**: Tools for automating the deployment process for my projects.
- **Automation**: Automating tasks like environment setup and backups.
- **Monitoring**: Tools to keep an eye on system performance and resources.
- **Project Management**: Manage tasks, code snippets, and boilerplates.
- **Misc**: Other scripts (esp ML, ChatGPT, OpenAI stuff).

There are usage instructions provided in each `README.md` file.
## Installation

To make the `devops-toolkit` scripts easily accessible from your terminal, run the `install.sh` script. It creates symbolic links for all executable scripts in the `/usr/local/bin` directory, allowing you to run the scripts by their name from any location.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/devops-toolkit.git`
2. Change to the `devops-toolkit` directory: `cd devops-toolkit`
3. Run the `install.sh` script: `sudo ./install.sh`

Now you can run any script by its name from your terminal. The `install.sh` script will also ensure that all the scripts are marked as executable.

**Note**: If you add new scripts to the repository, run the `install.sh` script again to update the symbolic links and mark new scripts as executable.
